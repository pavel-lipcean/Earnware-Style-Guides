# Earnware Design System

Earnware represents today a family products including Earnware Dashboard, Earnware Connect Wordpress Plugin and Feedpress Wordpress Plugins. 

Maintaining the brand, colors, look and feel across all these products is a challenge. We decided to eliminate all custom made components, create and adapt a design system that unites product teams around a common visual language.

HTML and Cascading Style Sheets are built based on [Bootstrap CSS Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/), following [Earnware 3.0 design standards](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100506235/Earnware-Dashboard-30) and Earnware 3.0 Figma guides;

## About Earnware

[Earnware](https://www.earnware.com/) serves web publishers with millions of visitors and the advertisers trying to reach them.

Publishing good content is hard enough. Generating thousands of new subscribers daily, tens-of-thousands of daily visitors and making enough advertising sales to manage and grow a web business is even harder. These specialized skills and resources are not generally available for sale. Anyone with the proven abilities to generate subscribers, traffic and revenue (at a profit) just does it for themselves.
